raise funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s Costume Institute.</p>\n<p>The Gala returns after being delayed last year due to the pandemic but was nothing short of excitement.</p>\n<p>Many famous guests followed Covid-19 rules which include wearing masks indoors but that didn&#8217;t stop many from going for all-out glamour.</p>\n<p>One of the bigger stars of the event was singer Billie Eilish.</p>\n<p>She co-hosted the event and drew comparisons with Marilyn Monroe.</p>\n<p>She co-hosted the show alongside tennis player Naomi Osaka, actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and poet Amanda Gorman.</p>\n<p><strong>Below are some of the pictures from the event.</strong></p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s costume theme is &#8220;In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,&#8221; &#8211; and the looks were inspired by everything from the Matrix film franchise to the Statue of Liberty.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_752421\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-752421\" style=\"width: 600px\"

Those guys are like, boom,\u201d Momoa, 40, told Esquire.</p>\n<p>He also spoke highly of his Dune co-star Timothee Chalamet, saying, \u201cI would never be able to handle what he does. He\u2019s so f***ing talented, man. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a little dumber, needed some time. Which is probably the best for me because it would have been bad if it happened when I was younger.

He joked that there were so many nominees making history that \u201cif you are a nominee tonight who isn\u2019t making history, shame on you.\u201d Though Kimmel was joking, he made a very good point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He mentioned in his monologue how, at 22 years old, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was the youngest Best Actor nominee in nearly 80 years. Christopher Plummer was the oldest Best Actor nominee ever at 88 years old. Greta Gerwig was the first female nominated for Best Director in eight years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Peele was only the third person in the history of the Oscars to be nominated for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture and Best Director</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for his debut film. After Kimmel mentioned all of these milestones in the first 10 minutes, there was a certain feeling in the air that last night\u2019s Oscars would be big.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something everyone always wants to know after each Academy Awards is who was the biggest winner of the night. Somewhat unsurprisingly, that distinction goes to \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d which came away with four Oscars after being nominated for 13 separate awards. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d didn\u2019t come away with every big award \u2013 Sally Hawkins lost out to Frances McDormand for Best Leading Actress \u2013 it still captured some high-profile wins. Director Guillermo del Toro captured his first two Oscars with wins for both Best Director and the biggest award of the night, Best Picture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Del Toro gave an extremely heartfelt acceptance speech for each win, and his speeches were especially poignant in today\u2019s political climate. He talked about growing up in Mexico and achieving his childhood dream of becoming a filmmaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guillermo del Toro has been in the movie business for nearly 25 years, and he had never won an Academy Award before Sunday. In fact, he had only been nominated for two awards in the past \u2013 Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Film, both for \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d in 2007. It was truly a satisfying moment for any of del Toro\u2019s loyal fanbase to see him recognized on a national scale as the talented artist he has always been.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guillermo del Toro\u2019s speeches were not the only heartfelt moments of the night, though. In what some would consider one of the biggest surprises of the night, Jordan Peele came away with the award for Best Original Screenplay for \u201cGet Out.\u201d In some ways, it truly did feel like Peele\u2019s night as the Dolby Theatre erupted into cheers when \u201cGet Out\u201d was named in the nominees. What made Peele\u2019s acceptance speech unique and emotional was the genuine appreciation he expressed by thanking every fan of the film for assisting in making it the enormous success it was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what was easily the most emotional moment of the night was the acceptance speech of Frances McDormand for Best Leading Actress. She was so shocked and nervous that she fumbled over her words a little as she spoke on stage, but at a certain point in her speech, she asked every woman in the room who was nominated for an award to stand up to receive some recognition and be taken seriously in the future. McDormand\u2019s sharing of the spotlight was the tear-jerking moment of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other big winners include \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d for Best Adapted Screenplay, Allison Janney for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d Gary Oldman for Best Actor for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d and \u201cCoco\u201d for Best Animated Feature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Oscars was not all serious, though. There was a contest to see who could deliver the shortest acceptance speech, with the winner receiving a jet ski. Mark Bridges, costume designer for \u201cThe Phantom Thread,\u201d won the jet ski. Jimmy Kimmel gathered a group of actors to go surprise an audience at the nearby movie theater with snacks and a hot dog launcher. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the 90</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Academy Awards had its serious moments and its fun moments, and anyone who tuned in definitely enjoyed the show.</span></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>This past Sunday, ABC broadcast the three-hourlong 90th Annual Academy Awards, hosted this year by Jimmy Kimmel.

When the nominees for the Academy Awards were announced more than a month ago, they nearly broke the internet for multiple reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Peele, of \u201cKey and Peele\u201d fame, released his full-length feature film \u201cGet Out\u201d to critical acclaim last year before the Oscar season and many fans of his film were disappointed that it wasn\u2019t considered for an Oscar last year. This year, \u201cGet Out\u201d is up for four Oscars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many movie fans were also excited to see \u201cLogan\u201d nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, marking the first time a comic book movie has been nominated for such an award. Movie fans also caused an uproar when \u201cThe Boss Baby,\u201d a film that many thought was mediocre at best, was named as one of the nominees for Best Animated Feature. With so much buzz around this year\u2019s Oscars, the show is bound to be an exciting one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Best Animated Feature</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of Best Animated Feature, \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d faces some stiff competition. \u201cThe Breadwinner\u201d currently sits at a 94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cLoving Vincent,\u201d the animated biopic about Vincent van Gogh, set a record of being the first fully painted film. \u201cFerdinand\u201d and \u201cCoco\u201d were both family-friendly fan favorites this year. However, since \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is probably going home with Best Original Song Award, the new Pixar film will have to settle for Best Animated Feature.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prediction: Coco</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Best Original Screenplay</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Original Screenplay is one of the four awards that \u201cGet Out\u201d was nominated for this year. \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d also makes an appearance here as a film that was loved by both fans and critics alike. Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d was a brilliantly original film, and \u201cLady Bird\u201d has been getting a lot of critical love. Martin McDonagh\u2019s incredible writing in \u201cThree Billboards\u201d cannot be overlooked, though, and many people feel that this is his year in this category.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prediction: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri </span></i></p>\n<p><b>Best Adapted Screenplay</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">James Franco ran away with hearts this year with his performance in \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d, and it is no surprise that this film is one of the nominees for Best Adapted Screenplay. \u201cMudbound\u201d flew under too many people\u2019s radars, especially in comparison to films like \u201cLogan\u201d and \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d Following the critical success of \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d Aaron Sorkin\u2019s second adaptation, \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d was good enough to score him his second Oscar nomination, but it wasn\u2019t quite good enough to win. Apologies to any \u201cX-Men\u201d fans as well, because not even Wolverine could win this one.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prediction: Call Me by Your Name</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Best Actress</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d and \u201cLady Bird\u201d provided solid candidates for the Best Actress award this year with Sally Hawkins, Frances McDormand, and Saoirse Ronan, respectively. The incredible Meryl Streep also received a nomination for her performance in \u201cThe Post,\u201d and Margot Robbie solidified her status as a force to be reckoned with this year, as she can now add an Academy Award nomination to her already impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9. However, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone besides McDormand walking away with the award this year.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prediction: Frances McDormand</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Best Actor</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On any other year, the award for Best Actor would be a tough prediction. Daniel-Day Lewis and Timothee Chalamet both turned in stellar performances this year, and the face of Daniel Kaluuya from the \u201cGet Out\u201d poster continues to haunt dreams. Denzel Washington did an excellent job, as always, but this year had a clear winner. Gary Oldman\u2019s performance in \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d surpassed everyone else\u2019s performance. Oldman has never won an Oscar, and many folks from the industry are saying that this will be his last year. It\u2019s very clear who the winner will be here.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prediction: Gary Oldman</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Best Picture</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By far the toughest race to call this year is the award for Best Picture. \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d \u201cDunkirk,\u201d and \u201cGet Out\u201d are all strong candidates. Even outsiders like \u201cThe Post\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Thread\u201d don\u2019t seem too unreasonable. However, the front-runners for this award are \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri,\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water.\u201d These two have been splitting awards throughout the awards season, and this race is almost too close to call. While both films are worthy candidates, it looks like del Toro will be adding another Oscar win to his list of awards and accomplishments.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prediction: The Shape of Water</span></i></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>The biggest night in Hollywood is approaching, as Jimmy Kimmel hosts the 90th Academy Awards at 7 p.m. Sunday on ABC.

The lush and summery setting, the carefree attitudes of the characters, the intense, emotional love the main characters feel for one another all ran through my head until I could see it a second time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film was like a vivid dream. I had to watch it again not to find new meaning or remember the details but to confirm that the film\u2019s events had occurred in such a mystifyingly beautiful way. I watched in the same way one recalls a memory and discusses it rapidly with others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d adapted by writer James Ivory from Andr\u00e9 Aciman\u2019s 2007 novel of the same name, follows the lives of protagonists Elio and Oliver across six weeks of one summer. It is 1983 when Oliver, a 24-year-old American graduate student played by Armie Hammer, arrives in Northern Italy to stay with the Perlman family and study classical art under the father, a professor of archaeology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oliver shares the upstairs of the Perlman\u2019s home with the 17-year-old Elio, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The fact that Oliver takes Elio\u2019s bedroom, along with the arrogance and hastiness that Elio perceives in Oliver even when his parents don\u2019t, creates an initial awkwardness and disrupts Elio\u2019s plan of \u201cwaiting for summer to end.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What follows this initial awkwardness is first a hesitant friendship then a romantic relationship, as Elio comes to understand his feelings and admit them to Oliver. Though Elio and Oliver must grapple with the realities of their love, the film never slips into melodrama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalamet, who also appeared in 2017\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cLady Bird,\u201d performs masterfully in \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d Ivory\u2019s writing includes little internal monologue or discussion of Elio\u2019s thoughts, and it is Chalamet\u2019s acting that puts us deep into Elio\u2019s mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private moments, such as Elio reading Oliver\u2019s notes or sniffing his clothing, give insight into Elio\u2019s development as Chalamet conveys uneasiness of a young person confronting unfamiliar feelings and the nervousness of a first, true love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admittedly, the film moves slowly, and the characters rarely tell viewers what to think. That is until Professor Perlman, played by Michael Stuhlbarg in the best single-scene performance of the film, delivers a powerful monologue to his son. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything, what a waste \u2026 Right now, there\u2019s sorrow and pain. Don\u2019t kill it, and with it the joy you felt,\u201d says the professor with tears in his eyes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the development of Elio and Oliver\u2019s romance seems sudden, director Luca Guadagnino lays out all the signs for us, and it is on viewers to pay attention to the details the film includes. Guadagnino\u2019s film is also grounded in the concrete details \u2013 things as small as clothing, books and decorations \u2013 which give insight into the characters\u2019 personalities and bring readers into the world of 1980s Italy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With striking shots of leaves in the wind, water dripping off bodies and characters eating messy foods like eggs and fruit, watching this film employs all senses. The film features three songs from indie artist Sufjan Stevens and classical piano pieces used to signal key moments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d is a fascinating, wonderful movie suffused with details and focused on the type of love nearly all people seek. Catch it in theaters in Oxford at Malco Commons before the Oscars in March.</span></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>When I first saw the new film \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.

Throughout the movie, we see both women traverse the same routes of the city they will continue to share for only a few more months, as their bonds stretch and fray, mend, change, and stretch again. As their separation looms, so their relationship grows deeper to the point where the slightest nonverbal gesture says more than an entire lecture, while a simple written letter is harder than a thousand spoken words.</p>\n<p>Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), who prefers to go by \u201cLady Bird\u201d at her Catholic high school, is a gangly, wide-eyed senior with a messy Manic Panic bob and an internal countdown to leave \u201csoul-killing\u201d Sacramento, the \u201cMidwest of California.\u201d</p>\n<p>She longs for the \u201cculture\u201d of the East Coast schools, but her mom, Marion (Laurie Metcalf) has neither the desire nor the money to send her across the country. The McPhersons live in the more working-class side of town in a modest home with one bathroom for five people, where a trip to the grocery store is met with anxiety at the register, and any blip on a high school transcript could affect financial aid or admission into college. Marion and Lady Bird\u2019s father, Larry (Tracy Letts), scraped tuition together so their daughter could go to a private high school, so the looming spectre of college fees are a daily source of tension and stress.</p>\n<p>The trouble with Lady Bird and Marion is that they are so much alike and so dependent on each other for emotional sustenance, even if it drives the other crazy. As they scour the racks at the local thrift shop, it is like watching two halves of a whole fighting to speak over the other as they scrutinize each other\u2019s walk, comments, attitude, and influence. Marion worries that Lady Bird may be too influenced by her wealthier friends. Lady Bird wants Marion to stop noticing every detail of her life. They pause briefly to agree on a dress and reach a temporary detente until the next battle looms.</p>\n<p>Writer-director Gerwig, who was born in Sacramento and went to college on the east coast, treats the city with a fond poignancy of someone who remembers every route to treasured places, the nicer neighborhoods with the pretty houses, the clubs where the cute boys hung out or played in their bands. Lady Bird and her best friend, Julie (Beanie Feldstein) lean on each other as only childhood friends can, with that stifled, unsettling feeling that their good times together are numbered.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, separation comes as a defense mechanism as a delay against the inevitable.</p>\n<p>Lady Bird fights against so much inevitable, from her father losing his job and taking pills for depression to her mom making too much sense during her lectures.</p>\n<p>She longs to breathe and stretch and stumble around, free from the ordinary comforts and conventions of the hometown she\u2019s known her entire life. Gerwig doesn\u2019t let her off easy either, as she makes Marion and Larry have soul and heart and tenacity and perseverance \u2014 all of which their daughter observes even when she refuses to see. Larry stoops to apply for a job he is overqualified and too old for (and for which his stepson applies, too). Marion complains about being the \u201cbad cop\u201d when disciplining her daughter but refuses to relent on her work ethic to raise a daughter who realizes that she is connected to people who have sacrificed to give her choice and opportunity.</p>\n<p>All the merits of Gerwig\u2019s sharp, funny, and bittersweet script would not have the urgency and intensity without the tremendous cast who embody their characters with eloquence and depth. Aside from the excellent Metcalf and Letts, the other mature actors who play the teaching priests and nuns at the high school are wonderful as well, especially Lois Smith as a guidance counselor and Stephen Henderson in a heartbreaking turn as an emotionally fragile drama coach.</p>\n<p>Saoirse Ronan is one of the brightest stars of her generation, able to switch from ebullient to tormented, confident to awkward in an instant and never uttering a false note. She is magic to watch and has that oldsoul gravitas, like a young Jodie Foster or Natalie Wood. Her fellow costars are to be commended as well, especially Feldstein as the effervescent Julie, as secure in her future as Lady Bird is anxious.</p>\n<p>Together, the two investigate the whispered intricacies of teenage femininity, from sexuality and self-pleasure to prom fashions. Lucas Hedges and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet play two suitors vying for her affections but with different dramas behind the charming personas of high-school crushes. Through it all, Lady Bird is so sure she is done with Sacramento simply because she has memorized every inch of it, while really it, and its people, has formed how she will see the world from then on.</p>\n<p><block class=\"related_content\" style=\"More Information\" title=\"RATING\"></p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p></block><block class=\"related_content\" style=\"More Information\" title=\"More Information\"></p>\n<p>\u201cLady Bird\u201d (2017)</p>\n<p>STARRING Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Jordan Rodrigues, Beanie Feldstein, Lucas Hedges, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Lois Smith, Stephen Henderson, Marielle Scott, Odeya Rush</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR Greta Gerwig</p>\n<p>MPAA RATING R</p>\n<p></block></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>BY BROOK CORSO The opening scene of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird\u201d begins with a top shot of the titular character and her mother facing each other as they sleep on a bed while on a college tour.

On Wednesday, costumed men wearing top hats and ladies in Victorian petticoat dresses strolled along the tree-lined path.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible to imagine Louisa May Alcott walking here,\u201d said Friedman. \u201cCreating a backdrop for something as wonderful as this book is extraordinary.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the moment, the historical nature, it\u2019s a magical mix.\u201d</p>\n<p>Filming lasted one day and took place on a segment of Meadow Road. On hand were the film\u2019s director and writer, Greta Gerwig, and stars Meryl Streep, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Florence Pugh. The Arboretum is one of several locations in the Boston area being used as set pieces for the movie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are honored and thrilled to be filming \u2018Little Women\u2019 in the beautiful Arnold Arboretum, a great Boston treasure since the days of Louisa May Alcott,\u201d said Amy Pascal, the film\u2019s producer.</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle Women\u201d is the first movie to be filmed at the Arnold Arboretum, which was established in 1872. Friedman said the story speaks to Harvard\u2019s and the Arboretum\u2019s values \u2014 aspects of inclusion and diversity, and the eternal quest to achieve one\u2019s aspirations. It not only examines the period when the Alcott family was exploring how to educate, but also a time of great social change \u2014 a time when, like today, questions about women and empowerment resonated, he said.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"gz-explore  center-aligned\">\n\n\t\t<h3 class=\"tz-explore__explore-flag\">Related</h3>\n\n\t\t\n<div id=\"post-241455\" class=\"tz-explore post-241455 post

bash famed for its over-the-top panache &#8212; and, despite the pandemic, this year the fashion was so fierce one guest wielded a sword.</p>\n<p>The crowd of some 400 actors, athletes, poets and performers &#8212; all of whom were either vaccinated or had tested negative for Covid-19 &#8212; was largely maskless on the cream carpet, defying the global coronavirus pandemic that forced the cancellation of last year&#8217;s event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so surreal,&#8221; US rapper Megan Thee Stallion, attending the Gala for the first time and dressed by designer Coach to evoke old Hollywood glamor, told AFP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like, oh my gosh, Houston, Texas we made it! &#8230; I&#8217;m excited to be here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But she did admit that it was &#8220;kinda weird&#8221; to be around so many people, more than 18 months into the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve kinda gotten used to being a little introvert like &#8212; but I&#8217;m back on side so I&#8217;m excited to see everybody,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Canadian musician Grimes, who was one of the few wearing a face mask, set Twitter alight by carrying a sword &#8212; perhaps to, as one user suggested, &#8220;make sure people stay 6 ft away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>US lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez added to the revolutionary spirit with a white off-shoulder dress, on the back of which was written in scarlet capital letters: &#8220;Tax the rich&#8221; &#8212; an inflammatory statement at an event where tickets cost $35,000 apiece and tables were up to $300,000.</p>\n<p>Singer Normani said her yellow Valentino gown &#8220;chose me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like a princes&#8230; sorry I&#8217;m breathing heavy, my waist is snatched,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel like&#8230; amazing. A Black queen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rapper Lil Nas X stripped down to reveal not one, but three gold outfits, singer Frank Ocean appeared with lime green hair and carrying what Twitter users described as a &#8220;robot baby&#8221; and Simone Biles&#8217; glittering silver-and-black dress was so heavy that the gymastics superstar could only climb the stairs one foot at a time and needed six men to help her lift it.</p>\n<p>The rapper ASAP Rocky appeared wrapped in a patchwork quilt, which he said was a sartorial message of unity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We part of the same cloth, part of the same quilt, you know?&#8221; he said with a grin &#8212; later tossing the quilt to the ground to reveal a sharp black suit underneath, to the delight of singer Rihanna, his date.</p>\n<p>One mysterious guest appeared head to toe in black &#8212; her face, mouth, eyes and head also covered, with only a long black ponytail visible, leading many to identify her as reality star Kim Kardashian.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe? We think it&#8217;s her?&#8221; tweeted New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman.</p>\n<p>&#8211; &#8216;Evolving language of fashion&#8217; &#8211;</p>\n<p>Actor Timothee Chalamet, poet Amanda Gorman, singer Billie Eilish and tennis player Naomi Osaka co-chaired the charity ball often heralded as the celebrity world&#8217;s &#8220;party of the year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Normally held in early May, the Manhattan soiree on steroids was postponed to Monday with the hope that Covid-19 restrictions would be lifted. The 2020 edition was canceled due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The honorary co-chairs were Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, who has turned the gala into a global event, designer Tom Ford and Adam Mosseri, director of Instagram, which is sponsoring the extravaganza.</p>\n<p>Plans for an opulent spectacle as much of the United States and the world is still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic had risked criticism, but the primary reason for holding the benefit was almost certainly financial.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s Costume Institute relies on the Met Gala to fund its work, including exhibitions and acquisitions, and the cancellation of last year&#8217;s event badly damaged its finances.</p>\n<p>The bash heralded the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s annual sartorial exhibit, which this year will happen in two parts.</p>\n<p>The first show, titled &#8220;In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,&#8221; is opening to the public September 18 to celebrate The Costume Institute&#8217;s 75th anniversary.</p>\n<p>The second exhibit &#8212; &#8220;In America: An Anthology of Fashion&#8221; &#8212; will kick off May 5, 2022. Both will run until September 5 of that year.</p>\n<p>The exhibits themselves will see Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton continue to explore broad themes &#8212; &#8220;Camp,&#8221; Catholicism and China were among the focuses in recent years &#8212; rather than offer retrospectives of a specific designer.</p>\n<p>The two-part show will assess the state of American fashion &#8212; its contemporary players, the industry&#8217;s identity, and important figures the rarified world of fashion may have overlooked or left out.</p>\n<p>Bolton said the exhibit&#8217;s first stage would focus on modernizing fashion vocabulary in connection with &#8220;equity, diversity and inclusion,&#8221; as part two would see collaborations with American filmmakers to &#8220;further investigate the evolving language of American fashion.&#8221;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>New York is done with dressing down: the splashy black-tie Met Gala returned Monday, with a cohort of Gen-Z&#8217;s glitterati hosting the A-lister bash famed for its over-the-top panache &#8212; and, despite the pandemic, this year the fashion was so fierce one guest wielded a sword.

The technology wasn\u2019t there yet, but also the source material is just too rich to introduce everybody to it in one movie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost everybody who\u2019s read Frank Herbert\u2019s masterpiece agrees on its quality, the problem has been with translating the magic of the dense 400 page novel into a tight two-hour viewing experience. Many have claimed that it can\u2019t be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plot of the novel is such that it\u2019s impossible to understand the plot without first understanding the universe that \u201cDune\u201d is set in, and the politics surrounding the characters and their families. Not a problem for a novel, as dedicating a page to exposition in text is not the cardinal sin that it is in film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exposition in movies has to be effortless. It\u2019s best done through dialogue or visuals, allowing the audience to piece together information to create a complete story. That, for decades, has been the problem with adapting \u201cDune.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which brings me to my second point: Denis Villenueve. The man is a masterful visual storyteller, and great at dropping exposition that isn\u2019t holding the audience\u2019s hand too much. Since he has two films to play with, Villanueve takes his time introducing the audience to the universe gradually. Viewers learn about the characters, the setting and the stakes of the plot, and it never feels rushed at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was what the fate of this movie hinged on, and I\u2019m glad they got it right. I watched the film with a friend who had not read the book, and he said that he had no problem understanding the plot or how the universe worked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villenueve\u2019s experience in the sci-fi genre and his love for the source material led to a visually stunning adaptation that effectively told the story of the \u201cDune\u201d universe. However, the emotional element is brought on by a very strong cast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is good as the protagonist Paul Atreides, but his character isn\u2019t meant to be all that complex, which is why Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica steals the show. Jessica is my favorite character from the book, and I think she\u2019s Villenueve\u2019s favorite too.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson does an amazing job adding energy to the movie, and her experience of the complex nature of the universe she\u2019s in is very well-reflected through her performance. Other performances from Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa and others were fairly strong, but the best performance of the film easily goes to Rebecca Ferguson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would always recommend reading the book version of \u201cDune\u201d before running to theaters, however, if it comes down to it, it&#8217;s worth going and seeing it on IMax due to just how good it looks on a huge screen. I do not think that watching this on HBO Max or in any small screen setting will have the same effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie does a really good job of filling you in on most of the first half of the book, and if you decide to watch the film and then read the book, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad way to go about it. However, if you\u2019re planning on watching the film in your living room, give the book a try first. You\u2019ll appreciate the choice Villenueve made more when you\u2019re going in realizing just how much ground he has to cover.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDune\u201d is playing in theaters throughout Savannah and is currently streaming on HBO Max.

The 2021 exhibition was named </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In America: A Lexicon of Fashion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and after more than a year of waiting, the stars&#8217; looks were full of glam and some left us filled with questions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, what is it that makes the Met Gala so magnificent? So captivating? So unlike the rest? Well, there are a few reasons. For those still in the dark, the Met Gala, formerly known as the Costume Institute, is an annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute in Manhattan, New York; and iIt is considered one of the most prestigious and most exclusive events in the world. This one night in New York is considered the top event of the year by many, so it\u2019s so clear as to why the stakes are so high when it comes to what to wear.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What started out as a unique fundraising event in 1948 has transformed into the couture fashion event of the year. It\u2019s become sort of a spoken rule, that once someone has made it to the Met Gala, then they\u2019ve \u201cmade it.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And after a year delay of the event due to Covid-19, there were quite a few first timers in attendance last night, although it\u2019s hard to tell with how incredible they all looked.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s take a look at the best (and worst) looks from the 2021 Met Gala.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><b>Olivia Rodrigo in Saint Laurent\u00a0</b></h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTyY0ymIm_Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTyY0ymIm_Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Met Gala 2021 (@_metgala2021)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cdeja vu\u201d singer paid homage to American punk by sporting a black lace YSL bodysuit.

Once the two get to know each other, Jack falls for Ennis and together the two try to keep their courtship despite extenuating circumstances such as each of them falling for women in their lives (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway). </p>\n<p><strong>Call Me By Your Name</strong></p>\n<p>Call Me By Your Name is based on the novel of the same name by Andre Aciman and is set in the summer of 1983. Elio, a young Jewish kid in Italy (Timothee Chalamet), meets a graduate student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) via his archeologist father. At first, Elio believes they have nothing in common, but after spending time with each other, Elio is attracted to Oliver, but he does not reciprocate. However, Oliver has a change of heart and is willing to take a chance on the 17-year-old. </p>\n<p><strong>Milk</strong></p>\n<p>Milk tells the true story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), who was the first openly gay person to be elected to office in California. His goal was to be a gay activist and his growing up of people not acceping his sexuality motivated him to move to San Francisco where people would be more accepting and that he would have more and better opportunities to succeed. Milk faces a lot of opposition, but his determination continues to be a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Bohemian Rhapsody</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the true story of the band Queen and more specifically its flamboyant, charismatic lead singer Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek), Bohemian Rhapsody starts with the group&#8217;s inception of how the band met and how their passion for music ultimately led them to become one of the biggest rock bands of all time. All the while, Mercury struggles with his sexuality, especially with his girlfriend Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton).  Nevertheless, Mercury and Queen press on to become the band they were and leave behind their enduring musical legacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Rocketman</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking of musical legacies, this operatic telling of Elton John&#8217;s musical journey is equally as flashy and compelling. Taron Egerton plays John as a man who has had some many ups and downs both personally and professionally and yet he does his best to rise above such obstacles to become the well-loved performer he is today and also hoping to be loved and accepted as he is. Rocketman features electrifying musical numbers set to John&#8217;s most iconic tunes and it also demonstrates Egerton as a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>To commemorate Pride Month, here are a few movies that deal with relationships within the LGBTQ+ community: Brokeback Mountain Brokeback Mountain tells the story of two cowboys Ennis and Jack (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) who are hired by a farmer to herd sheep on his ranch in Wyoming in 1963.

Throughout the movie, we see both women traverse the same routes of the city they will continue to share for only a few more months, as their bonds stretch and fray, mend, change, and stretch again. As their separation looms, so their relationship grows deeper to the point where the slightest nonverbal gesture says more than an entire lecture, while a simple written letter is harder than a thousand spoken words.</p>\n<p>Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), who prefers to go by \u201cLady Bird\u201d at her Catholic high school, is a gangly, wide-eyed senior with a messy Manic Panic bob and an internal countdown to leave \u201csoul-killing\u201d Sacramento, the \u201cMidwest of California.\u201d</p>\n<p>She longs for the \u201cculture\u201d of the East Coast schools, but her mom, Marion (Laurie Metcalf) has neither the desire nor the money to send her across the country. The McPhersons live in the more working-class side of town in a modest home with one bathroom for five people, where a trip to the grocery store is met with anxiety at the register, and any blip on a high school transcript could affect financial aid or admission into college. Marion and Lady Bird\u2019s father, Larry (Tracy Letts), scraped tuition together so their daughter could go to a private high school, so the looming spectre of college fees are a daily source of tension and stress.</p>\n<p>The trouble with Lady Bird and Marion is that they are so much alike and so dependent on each other for emotional sustenance, even if it drives the other crazy. As they scour the racks at the local thrift shop, it is like watching two halves of a whole fighting to speak over the other as they scrutinize each other\u2019s walk, comments, attitude, and influence. Marion worries that Lady Bird may be too influenced by her wealthier friends. Lady Bird wants Marion to stop noticing every detail of her life. They pause briefly to agree on a dress and reach a temporary detente until the next battle looms.</p>\n<p>Writer-director Gerwig, who was born in Sacramento and went to college on the east coast, treats the city with a fond poignancy of someone who remembers every route to treasured places, the nicer neighborhoods with the pretty houses, the clubs where the cute boys hung out or played in their bands. Lady Bird and her best friend, Julie (Beanie Feldstein) lean on each other as only childhood friends can, with that stifled, unsettling feeling that their good times together are numbered.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, separation comes as a defense mechanism as a delay against the inevitable.</p>\n<p>Lady Bird fights against so much inevitable, from her father losing his job and taking pills for depression to her mom making too much sense during her lectures.</p>\n<p>She longs to breathe and stretch and stumble around, free from the ordinary comforts and conventions of the hometown she\u2019s known her entire life. Gerwig doesn\u2019t let her off easy either, as she makes Marion and Larry have soul and heart and tenacity and perseverance \u2014 all of which their daughter observes even when she refuses to see. Larry stoops to apply for a job he is overqualified and too old for (and for which his stepson applies, too). Marion complains about being the \u201cbad cop\u201d when disciplining her daughter but refuses to relent on her work ethic to raise a daughter who realizes that she is connected to people who have sacrificed to give her choice and opportunity.</p>\n<p>All the merits of Gerwig\u2019s sharp, funny, and bittersweet script would not have the urgency and intensity without the tremendous cast who embody their characters with eloquence and depth. Aside from the excellent Metcalf and Letts, the other mature actors who play the teaching priests and nuns at the high school are wonderful as well, especially Lois Smith as a guidance counselor and Stephen Henderson in a heartbreaking turn as an emotionally fragile drama coach.</p>\n<p>Saoirse Ronan is one of the brightest stars of her generation, able to switch from ebullient to tormented, confident to awkward in an instant and never uttering a false note. She is magic to watch and has that oldsoul gravitas, like a young Jodie Foster or Natalie Wood. Her fellow costars are to be commended as well, especially Feldstein as the effervescent Julie, as secure in her future as Lady Bird is anxious.</p>\n<p>Together, the two investigate the whispered intricacies of teenage femininity, from sexuality and self-pleasure to prom fashions. Lucas Hedges and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet play two suitors vying for her affections but with different dramas behind the charming personas of high-school crushes.

Josephine, played by Saoirse Ronan; Beth, played by Eliza Scanlen and Meg, played by Emma Watson. The movie takes the audience through their childhood and adulthood, as they go through the trials of life and love. The setting and time period delivers all the cozy feelings of fall, while also providing a relatable story about four women and the complexity of their family.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on Amazon Prime Video </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">| </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes 95%</span></i></p>\n<p><b>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Steven Spielberg science fiction film is set during the fall season and has many cute and festive scenes. Prominent actresses in this movie include Dee Wallace and Drew Barrymore. A young kid and his imaginary friend are the main characters of this movie, but people soon find out that his friend is not so imaginary after all.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on Netflix </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">| </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes 99%</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is based on the third novel of a seven-book series by J.K. Rowling. It follows three teenagers who attend a school named Hogwarts, where they practice magic. This mystical film has many seasonal scenes as it follows their fall semester, and includes the chopping up of some pumpkins in one scene. One of my favorite fall activities is to cuddle under a blanket with my warm cup of tea and watch this film, along with all the other Harry Potter movies.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on Peacock </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">| </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes 90%</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Lady Bird (2017)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this coming-of-age film, a troubled teenager goes through the usual struggles of being a high school senior such as college stress, identity crisis and conflicts with her mother. This movie includes notable actors and actresses such as Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Stephen McKinley. Personally, this movie has helped me a lot with figuring out myself. I love to watch it during this season because it\u2019s a good comfort movie to combat the stress of school.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on Paramount Plus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">| </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes 99%</span></i></p>\n<p><b>When Harry Met Sally\u2026 (1989)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This notable romantic comedy perfectly fulfills the fall aesthetic. It includes many autumn scenes, like walks through the park filled with fallen leaves. This movie follows two people: Harry Burns, played by Billy Crystal and Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan. These friends decide to drive across the country together where they battle the question, \u2018can men and women solely be friends?\u2019 By the end of the movie, this question is answered.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on HBO Max </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">| </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes 91%\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><b>The Twilight Saga (2008-2012)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series is set in Forks, Washington. The climate of the area adds to the feelings of fall as the town is mostly \u201cunder a constant cover of rain and clouds,\u201d according to the main character Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart. This film series follows her moving to this town in the middle of the school year. As awkward as she is, she manages to make many new friends, and a mysterious new love interest.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available on Netflix | Rotten Tomatoes average of

They are definitely something to be treasured in film history, due to their lack of self awareness, weak technological approaches and overall incoherence.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given recent circumstances, now is the perfect time to stay indoors and watch movies. I\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the worst films I\u2019ve ever seen, but still love to watch.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> \u201cThe Room,\u201d (2003)</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directed by Tommy Wiseau, this\u00a0 horrible masterpiece is famously regarded as one of the worst films ever made because of its complete lack of awareness and narrative devices. This nonsensical romantic drama stars Gregory Sestero, Juliette Danielle and Wiseau as the lead.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story follows Wiseau as Johnny, a successful banker, as he loses control of his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa (played by Danielle,) because of her affair with Johnny\u2019s best friend, Mark (Sestero.) It does not have a cohesive plot, professional acting nor any impressive technical feats, yet it has gained a huge cult following over the years.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it came time for the public release of \u201cThe Room,\u201d it premiered at only two theatres in Los Angeles, one of them reserved for Wiseau, the cast and the press. Scott Foundas, a former reporter at Variety, attended the screening and </span><a href=\"https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/the-room-1117921325/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote that the film</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was so bad that \u201cmost of its viewers asked for their money back \u2014 before even 30 minutes [had] passed.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a lot of creative disagreement between Wiseau and the cast members, as told by Sestero in \u201cThe Disaster Artist,\u201d a memoir written by Sestero in which he describes his experiences living and working with Wiseau during the making of \u201cThe Room.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The memoir was later the basis for a biographical comedy of the same name in 2017, starred and directed by James Franco.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recommend watching \u201cThe Room,\u201d at least once if you have yet to see it in all its glory. Despite its flaws, it has so many hilariously quotable lines, and the performances are absolutely ludicrous.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Where to watch: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youtube</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b> \u201cFateful Findings,\u201d (2012)</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carrying a similar energy and cult following to \u201cThe Room,\u201d \u201cFateful Findings,\u201d was directed, written, produced and edited by Neil Breen.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plot of this film is all over the place, and is practically impossible to explain. Breen himself stars as Dylan, a writer/computer scientist/government hacker with magical powers given to him by a stone that he found in the woods when he was a child.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dylan encounters many hurdles while unveiling top-secret government databases, such as getting hit by a car, dealing with his wife\u2019s drug addiction and finding his best friend dead in his garage. To cope with his losses, he reconnects with his childhood friend, Lea, and quickly begins a romantic relationship with her.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breen\u2019s films are so fascinating because they are unashamedly the weirdest movies ever. Without giving away too much, everything is extremely bizzare and unpredictable, from the bad acting delivery to the amateur editing and effects.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://influxmagazine.com/an-interview-with-director-neil-breen\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with Influx magazine,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Breen spoke about the film and his non-conforming style of filmmaking, saying that it combines genres.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve never made a genre-specific film,\u201d Breen said. \u201cEven my fourth film that I\u2019m writing right now is very genre-defying. That\u2019s me and that\u2019s what I like doing.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><b>Where to watch: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vudu or iTunes</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b> \u201cAcross the Universe,\u201d (2007)</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directed by Julie Taymor, this original romance/musical takes place before, during and after the Vietnam war. However, all of the music is popular Beatles tunes, and each character references a name from a Beatles song.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main characters, Jude and Lucy, meet through Lucy\u2019s rebellious brother, Max, and later meet more characters along their romantic journey such as Prudence, Sadie and Jo-Jo.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie features several characters and side plots that can be confusing and hard to follow. The timeline seemingly spans years, but it is not specified which year the film starts and ends, which adds to the disorientation.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/forever-contemporary-julie-taymor-on-the-rerelease-of-across-the-universe\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview for film critic Robert Ebert,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Taymor said that 33 songs were picked and placed throughout the film to reflect the growth of the Beatles.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAcross the Universe,\u201d received mixed reviews, from the people who adored it and others who couldn\u2019t see past its messy plot and underdeveloped characters. I personally enjoy the idea behind the film, the Beatles and their music, but I am unsure how I feel about it in a campy, CGI heavy psychedelic musical.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, this is a great film to put on with friends who enjoy musicals and Beatles\u2019 songs (or both at the same time.)</span></p>\n<p><b>Where to watch: Hulu</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><b> \u201cHot Summer Nights,\u201d (2017)</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directed by Elijah Bynum, this film stars Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet, Maika Monroe and Alex Roe in a wild coming of age tale distributed by popular indie film company A24.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was disappointed after watching it because I didn\u2019t see a clear purpose to the film at all. It takes place in the summer of 1991 in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Chalamet\u2019s character, Daniel, is staying with his aunt and meets the bad boy in town, Hunter (played by Roe), in a convenience store. Together they sell marijuana to local customers, and their clients get increasingly more dangerous.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A24 is generally known for distributing high-brow artsy movies, but every once and a while a film comes along out of left field, leaving everyone scratching their heads as to why it was picked up by such an esteemed company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of those films, with its chaotic and incohesive editing, as each creative choice feels out of place and random.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was anticipating the film from what I saw from the trailer; it seemed like a new twist on the summer coming of age film, starring one of my favorite actors. I thought, \u201cWhat could be better?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One half of the plot is Daniel and Hunter flipping marijuana to an array of \u201980s hit songs, and the other half seems like a pointless romantic side plot that never develops.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire point of a coming-of-age film is to focus on the transitions and changes the protagonist goes through, but this one feels empty and lacks character development.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the soundtrack for the movie is undeniably great. Each song was nicely selected and helps move the film along, allowing for an enjoyable watch for the soundtrack alone.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Where to watch: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Prime Video</span></p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Vaila DeYoung, Contributing Writer Objectively bad movies are some of the best to watch because of their absurdity, hilariousness and often-poor acting.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The internet\u2019s beloved up-and-coming American actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet marked his first official return to film in 2019 with David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s Shakespearean action-drama, \u201cThe King.\u201d Strong performances paired with gorgeous lighting and cinematography make \u201cThe King\u201d feel like a Renaissance painting come to life.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is distributed by Netflix, which continually proves its worth as a renowned studio capable of producing well-directed, big-budget original movies.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe King\u201d was initially meant to be Chalamet\u2019s second film of the year. However, due to controversy around director Woody Allen, his latest 2019 film also starring Chalamet, \u201cA Rainy Day in New York\u201d was halted by its distributor, Amazon Studios. The film had a limited release in July 2019 in Poland, but was later dropped by Amazon, returning distribution rights back to Allen.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe King\u201d stars Chalamet as Hal, a drunken, good natured prince who ascends the throne as the heir to England following his father\u2019s death. As the new king, Henry V of England surrounds himself with loyal friends and followers, fighting to undo the wrongs of his father\u2019s reign.\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;Overall, the film was held together by talented actors, and the visuals were a beautiful contrast to the grim tone of the film.&#8221; \u2014 Vaila DeYoung</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film features its strong points through convincing characterizations of historical figures. The voice work and accents could use a little bit of tightening, but overall Mich\u00f4d manages to utilize contemporary actors as believable 15th century noblemen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with Chalamet, other outstanding performances include Robert Pattinson\u2019s exaggerated yet brief role as Louis, Dauphin of France, and co-writer and producer Joel Edgerton as Sir John Falstaff, Hal\u2019s loyal drinking buddy. Lily-Rose Depp as Catherine de Valois was an integral role and plot device for Hal\u2019s character development, and I wish she were given more to work with in this film. The importance of her character was far greater than what little screen time she had, but her performance was captivating and necessary nonetheless.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is based off the Shakespearean history plays, titled \u201cHenry IV,\u201d with parts one and two, and \u201cHenry V.\u201d The majority of the film\u2019s 2-hour-and-20-minute runtime is based off the plot of \u201cHenry V,\u201d focusing heavily on the events that lead to the Battle of Agincourt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without much knowledge of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, one might find it difficult to follow the narrative of the film. Although much of the play is condensed already, long dialogue sequences drag out the film.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The heart of the film tells a cautionary tale of the struggle between power and morality, but fails to dig deeper into the emotional toil that such conflict might cause.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The immaculate lighting and cinematography help to carry this film to the time period in which it takes place, from the subtle glow of the sunset, to more Rembrandt-style lighting with extremely dark shadows and soft contrasting highlights. Every shot featured incredible composition, leading visually stunning collections of imagery.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the film was held together by talented actors, and the visuals were a beautiful contrast to the grim tone of the film.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, \u201cThe King\u201d fails to achieve balance between dialogue-driven scenes, and contemplative moments to further show emotional shifts. This allows us to believe that it&#8217;s boring or slow, because the bulk of the film is quiet conversations between the main characters. For a film that includes plenty of dialogue, we gain little from the interactions.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 3/5</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

There are multiple categories that have no clear frontrunner, and the guilds and critics\u2019 awards have been largely split for most of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes the awards harder to predict, but previous winners and patterns followed by the academy can make the picture much clearer. Without further ado, here are my predictions for the 2019 Academy Awards.</span></p>\n<p><b>Best Picture nominations:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBlack Panther\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Favourite\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGreen Book\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRoma\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA Star is Born\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cVice\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will Win: \u201cRoma\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could Win: \u201cGreen Book\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should Win: \u201cThe Favourite\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toni Collette Award for worst snub: \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2019 best picture race is one of the stranger ones in recent memory, because this year, there\u2019s no clear favorite. Throughout the awards season, momentum changes and controversies come to light. But previously, there\u2019s been a favorite film which sweeps everything \u2014 like \u201cLa La Land\u201d or \u201cBirdman.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, a runaway favorite hasn\u2019t been crowned, which means there are three likely outcomes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRoma\u201d may win, leading to streaming services taking their long-awaited place at the top of the film industry just like they did with television. This would also cement director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s place in the pantheon of awarded filmmakers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Favourite\u201d would be the most logical \u2014 and arguably, the most preferred \u2014 outcome. This would follow an ongoing trend of the academy awarding bold and daring films, like \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If \u201cGreen Book\u201d wins best picture, it would likely outrage film Twitter and the planet along with it. But it\u2019s not an unlikely scenario. \u201dGreen Book\u201d recently won the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Producers Guild of America Award for best theatrical motion picture</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the backlash and controversy received by the film is not a good sign. For example, see previous controversial best picture nominees like \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d and \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The snub of \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d is confusing for many reasons. Director Barry Jenkins is a previous winner whose adaptations of timely and popular source material has made him one of the most influential filmmakers of all time. \u201cBeale Street\u201d has made appearances in numerous critics\u2019 shortlists, and it\u2019s a popular choice among industry guilds. Its snub at the 2019 Academy Awards would be a choice which fans and critics won\u2019t soon forget.</span></p>\n<p><b>Best Director nominations:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n \u2014 \u201cRoma\u201d</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_60925\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60925\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"60925\" data-permalink=\"https://commonwealthtimes.org/2019/02/23/predictions-for-the-2019-oscars/alfonso_cuaron_2013_cropped/\" data-orig-file=\"https://commonwealthtimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Alfonso_Cuar\u00f3n_2013_cropped.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2112,2816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 50D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1374322021&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Alfonso_Cuar\u00f3n_(2013)_cropped\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Roma&#8221; director Cuar\u00f3n will likely win best director, based on number of awards he&#8217;s already won for the film.

Cuar\u00f3n swept up many critics and guild awards, including the DGA, Bafta and Golden Globe awards for best director. I can\u2019t imagine anyone taking the Oscar from him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pawlikowski\u2019s nomination is a welcome surprise, and McKay should just be happy he\u2019s invited at all. Yorgos Lanthimos is a bit trickier\u2014\u201cThe Favourite\u201d got a ton of love with a staggering 10 nominations, but the academy has yet to fully embrace his weirdness. This is his first ever nomination. His time will come, but likely not this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only other likely scenario is Lee winning a much deserved award for best director. But seeing as he hasn\u2019t won any other major awards, it\u2019s pretty unlikely. A win in the category of best adapted screenplays is much more realistic for Lee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barry Jenkins\u2019 omission from the list is less surprising, since \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d was snubbed from best picture. But it\u2019s no less annoying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s jarring that no women are nominated. Directors Tamara Jenkins (\u201cPrivate Life\u201d), Debra Granik (\u201cLeave No Trace\u201d) and Josephine Decker (\u201cMadeline\u2019s Madeline\u201d) all missed the cut. </span></p>\n<p><b>Best Actress</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yalitza Aparicio \u2014 \u201cRoma\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glenn Close \u2014 \u201cThe Wife\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Colman \u2014 \u201cThe Favourite\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady Gaga \u2014 \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melissa McCarthy \u2014 \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will Win: Glenn Close</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could Win: Olivia Colman </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should Win: Olivia Colman</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toni Collette Award for worst snub: Toni Collette </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Awards season predictions made in the fall were positively unreliable \u2014 the best actress category is proof of just that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady Gaga was preemptively picked by many critics and film aficionados who believed no one had a chance of catching up to her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But everything changed when Close gave her Golden Globes acceptance speech for best actress in a drama.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close\u2019s speech exemplified how awards season momentum can change on a dime, and the second place can become the frontrunner in a matter of minutes. Her speech was a \u201cmoment\u201d voters love. She\u2019s a seven-time nominee with zero wins, so the academy will likely apologize in the form of an Oscar. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aparicio is a worthy contender, but voters rarely embrace newcomers so quickly. McCarthy was always someone with an outside shot at a nomination. At this point, Colman is the only real competition, with both BAFTA and Golden Globe wins. But Colman and McCarthy fans are two very different voting bodies that rarely cross over, so Close is a pretty safe bet.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_60930\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60930\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"60930\" data-permalink=\"https://commonwealthtimes.org/2019/02/23/predictions-for-the-2019-oscars/toni_collette_6902406229/\" data-orig-file=\"https://commonwealthtimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Toni_Collette_6902406229.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,667\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Eva Rinaldi&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 40D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1329679288&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;45&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.004&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Toni_Collette_(6902406229)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Toni Collette&#8217;s performance in &#8220;Hereditary&#8221; may have been one of the best performances of the century.

Ali is the type of actor the academy loves. He\u2019s great at his job, easy to like and a safe choice for voters who haven\u2019t seen any of the other films nominated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliot is a journeyman who definitely deserves recognition for his work, but his role in \u201cA Star is Born\u201d was just too small to make any real impact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grant is a gem that we don\u2019t deserve, and I\u2019m also really happy to see Driver getting some long overdue love. Rockwell was good in the ten minutes of screen time he had in \u201cVice,\u201d but this is another open and shut category. Mahershala has this in the bag.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s worth noting that the absence of Chalamet in this category is ridiculously confusing.

almost here to take those anxieties (mostly) away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of the year also means we\u2019re about to be hit by a wave of fantastic films all vying for Oscar nominations early next year and audience approval in the box office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m hoping to get the word out about some of these films and other notable releases during the break so that you can find something interesting to watch in between vacation time and family time.The one movie missing from this list is \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi.\u201d I know most of you have already bought your tickets, so it\u2019s kind of redundant to suggest it.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The Disaster Artist (December 8)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When most people watch Tommy Wiseau\u2019s infamously awful film \u201cThe Room,\u201d they laugh and move on. James Franco decided he wanted to tell Wiseau\u2019s story and how this trainwreck was made. Franco directs and stars in this comedic biopic full of big name stars who are all trying to recreate the madness that was the production of this garbage fire of a movie.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The Shape of Water (December 8)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guillermo Del Toro is the mastermind behind \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d and \u201cPacific Rim,\u201d and his latest film looks to be his most mature. It follows the love story of a mute woman played by Sally Hawkins and a humanoid aquatic creature living inside a government containment facility Hawkins cleans for. This strange romance looks to be beautifully filmed, and told and is certain to have the magical realism Del Toro is known for.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Call Me By Your Name (Currently in Limited Release)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set in Italy in the 1980s, this romantic drama sees a young Italian boy falling in love with his father\u2019s research assistant as he discovers his own sexuality. This movie has been making the rounds as of late and is looking to be the next big independent hit of the year if it gets a wider release. This drama has been praised for its cinematography and the performances from its lead actors, Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Director Luca Guadagnino is known for his ability to capture beauty and sensuality &#8212; this movie looks to be no exception.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Phantom Thread (December 25)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson and actor Daniel Day-Lewis worked together, they created \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d one of the most iconic and critically acclaimed movies of the 2000s. Now they\u2019ve joined forces again to produce a film exploring the life and relationships of a troubled fashion designer in 1950s England. This is said to be Day-Lewis\u2019 final performance before he retires and it&#8217;s guaranteed to at least be beautiful.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Molly\u2019s Game (December 25)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Molly Bloom is a former U.S. skier who was investigated by the FBI in the 2000s for running illegal underground poker games across the nation that included many socialites as players. Now in 2017, Aaron Sorkin, best known for writing award-winning scripts like \u201cThe Social Network\u201d and creating \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d is writing and making his directorial debut with the film adaptation of this bizarre story. With an A-list cast, and Jessica Chastain as Bloom, this is looking to be one of the year\u2019s most interesting movies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The Post (January 12)</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in a movie about how The Washington Post released the Pentagon Papers exposing the U.S. government&#8217;s involvement in the Vietnam war. What else do I need to say? Hanks and Streep are fantastic actors and the subject matter is fascinating and inherently intense. Plus, Spielberg has been synonymous with movie gold for the past few years. There\u2019s little to no chance of this being a bad movie.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Samuel Goodrich</strong>,<em>\u00a0</em></span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff Writer</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>While many VCU students struggle with end of the semester deadlines, winter break is almost here to take those anxieties (mostly) away.

"<p><strong>Entertainment Desk</strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of 2020, moviegoers were looking forward to seeing titles like\u00a0<em>Dune, Black Widow, In the Heights, Jungle Cruise, Eternals</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>West Side Story</em>\u00a0as well as long-awaited sequels to\u00a0<em>Coming to America</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Top Gun</em>\u00a0and the latest installments in the\u00a0<em>James Bond, Fast &amp; Furious, Ghostbusters</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Halloween</em>\u00a0franchises on the big screen.</p>\n<p>But just a few months into the year, everything changed with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic. As movie theaters closed, the release date dominoes started falling. While some films hopscotched around the 2020 calendar before giving up on the year and planning a 2021 release, others swiftly shifted into the next year.</p>\n<p>So as 2020 ends and 2021 begins, with its hope of a return to normal with the rollout of various COVID-19 vaccines, film fans are again hoping they can see a blockbuster tentpole on the big screen. But for those who are still hesitant,\u00a0Warner Bros. is planning to release\u00a0its full 2021 slate in theaters and on HBO Max and Paramount sold\u00a0<em>Coming 2 America</em>\u00a0to Amazon, allowing Eddie Murphy fans to catch his and Arsenio Hall&#8217;s many characters from the comfort of their own home.</p>\n<p>Read on for more on the films that were set for a 2020 release but are now set to debut in a very crowded 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Coming 2 America</strong><br />\nRelease date: March 5</p>\n<p>The long-awaited sequel to the 1988 Eddie Murphy hit was set to be released by Paramount in December before the studio sold the star-studded comedy to Amazon in late November for $125 million. The decision, Paramount chairman Jim Gianopulos told\u00a0<em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>\u00a0was made &#8220;with enormous difficulty.&#8221; &#8220;We were beautifully positioned during the\u00a0holiday season. It was counterprogramming to some of the other films that would have been on the schedule. There was a lot of heat on it. But we were faced with a reality, which is we had two full years of movies that were going to get crammed into probably a half a year of releases, the second half of \u201921. And so we had to make choices.&#8221; The film follows Murphy&#8217;s Prince Akeem, now set to become king, returning to America to find the son his father tells him he has. The Craig Brewer-directed film reteams Murphy with original cast members Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, Shari Headley and John Amos, with Murphy and Hall once again playing numerous characters. New cast members include Wesley Snipes, Leslie Jones, Tracy Morgan, Jermaine Fowler, KiKi Layne and Teyana Taylor.</p>\n<p><strong>The King&#8217;s Man</strong><br />\nRelease date: March 12</p>\n<p>Early in the pandemic, the Matthew Vaughn-directed prequel had a Sept. 18 release date, but by the end of the summer the 20th Century Studios film\u00a0had been pushed into 2021. Still, that didn&#8217;t stop a high-end clothing collaboration with Mr Porter from\u00a0debuting on Sept. 9\u00a0but some pieces were held back to coincide with the 2021 release. During the fall,\u00a0<em>The King&#8217;s Man</em>&#8216;s release date hopped around from February to March. The ensemble cast, for the film about the origins of the first independent intelligence agency, features Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Rhys Ifans, Matthew Goode, Daniel Br\u00fchl and Djimon Hounsou.</p>\n<p><strong>Morbius</strong><br />\nRelease date: March 19</p>\n<p><em>Morbius</em>\u00a0was one of the first films to move into 2021 in the early days of the pandemic, with Sony\u00a0announcing on March 30\u00a0that it was moving the Spider-Man spinoff, starring Jared Leto, from July 31, 2020 to March 19, 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>No Time to Die</strong><br />\nRelease date: April 2</p>\n<p><em>No Time to Die</em>\u00a0was the first Hollywood tentpole to shift its global release plan due to the coronavirus outbreak, making the first of many moves \u2014\u00a0from April to Thanksgiving\u00a0\u2014 in early March, before the World Health Organization had even labeled the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The 25th James Bond was\u00a0ultimately delayed to 2021\u00a0due to the ongoing pandemic. The film, in which star Daniel Craig will play 007 for the last time, is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga and stars Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Christoph Waltz, Rami Malek, Ana de Armas and Lashana Lynch. Appearing on\u00a0<em>The Tonight Show</em>\u00a0after the film&#8217;s latest delay was announced,\u00a0Craig said of the pandemic, &#8220;This thing is just bigger than all of us. We want to release the movie at the same time all around the world and this isn&#8217;t the right time. So fingers cross April 2 is going to be our date.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>A Quiet Place Part II</strong><br />\nRelease date: April 23</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>Quiet Place</em>\u00a0sequel, originally set for a March 20, 2020 theatrical release, had a\u00a0glitzy red-carpet premiere screening in New York City\u00a0just days before essential businesses in the Big Apple began shutting down. Star Emily Blunt later told\u00a0<em>THR</em>\u00a0of the\u00a0eleventh-hour delay\u00a0of the film directed by and starring husband John Krasinski, \u201cWell, what happened with<em>\u00a0Quiet Place</em>\u00a0was so surreal. At some point, it became very clear that the writing was on the wall, and [John] insisted that we pull the movie. He called the studio saying, \u2018You need to pull it right now. We\u2019re not bringing this movie out.\u2019 And then before too long, everyone was inside and I think it was surreal for everybody, not just for us.\u201d After\u00a0initially delaying\u00a0the film to Sept. 4, Paramount\u00a0shifted it again, to 2021, over the summer. Like the initial\u00a0<em>Quiet Place</em>, Krasinski directed and stars in the sequel alongside Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe and Cillian Murphy.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Widow</strong><br />\nRelease date: May 7</p>\n<p>The Marvel standalone, starring Scarlett Johansson as the titular superhero, was\u00a0quickly shifted from\u00a0its May 1, 2020 release date in the early days of the pandemic, as theaters closed throughout the U.S.,\u00a0first landing in November\u00a0before moving into 2021. Despite speculation that the movie, which also stars Florence Pugh and Rachel Weisz, would go directly to Disney+, during Disney&#8217;s investor day in December,\u00a0executives\u00a0indicated\u00a0that the tentpole would get a traditional theatrical release.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Guy</strong><br />\nRelease date: May 21</p>\n<p>The Ryan Reynolds-led sci-fi action-comedy about a non-player character in a video game who becomes self aware was initially set for a summer 2020 release before Disney&#8217;s 20th Century Studios\u00a0shifted the title to December. In early October, the\u00a0<em>Free Guy</em>\u00a0team posted\u00a0a video joking\u00a0about whether the film would make its 2020 release date, and sure enough, just weeks later, the\u00a0movie was moved into 2021. In addition to Reynolds, the Shawn Levy-directed title stars Jodie Comer, Joe Keery, Lil Rel Howery, Utkarsh Ambudkar and Taika Waititi.</p>\n<p><strong>Godzilla vs. Kong</strong><br />\nRelease date: May 21</p>\n<p><em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>, which\u00a0moved from Thanksgiving 2020 to May 21, 2021, is one of many Warner Bros. titles set to hit streamer HBO Max on the same day of its theatrical release. But before that news was announced,\u00a0Netflix had offered more than $200 million\u00a0for the monster movie from Legendary Pictures, which financed 75 percent of the film.\u00a0<em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>, directed by Adam Wingard, stars Alexander Skarsgard, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall and Kyle Chandler.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiral</strong><br />\nRelease date: May 21</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>Saw</em>\u00a0reboot starring Chris Rock saw its\u00a0release date pushed a year in May. The film also stars Samuel L. Jackson and Max Minghella, as the latter&#8217;s rookie cop and Rock&#8217;s detective investigate murders reminiscent of a gruesome past, with Rock&#8217;s character at the center of the killer&#8217;s deadly game.</p>\n<p><strong>F9</strong><br />\nRelease date: May 28</p>\n<p>In mid-March, the ninth and penultimate\u00a0<em>Fast &amp; Furious</em>\u00a0film\u00a0sped out of 2020 and zoomed into 2021,\u00a0initially nabbing the spot for the 10th and final installment in the franchise.\u00a0<em>F9</em>&#8216;s release was\u00a0later delayed to May 28, the beginning of Memorial Day weekend. The film is directed by franchise veteran Justin Lin, with returning stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster and Helen Mirren. New additions to the franchise in the latest film include John Cena and Cardi B.\u00a0Speaking to <em>THR</em>\u00a0over the summer about Universal&#8217;s early decision to push\u00a0<em>F9</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Minions</em>\u00a0into 2021, the studio&#8217;s Filmed Entertainment Group chairman Donna Langley said, &#8220;We weren&#8217;t popular with exhibitors, but we knew it was probably going to be the best thing for the movies, and now of course we are very relieved that we did. We got prime real estate next summer, and we prevented a lot of headaches. We had certainty about some things when there is so much uncertainty. We wanted to nail things down as best we could.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</strong><br />\nRelease date: June 11</p>\n<p>Unlike other titles that haunted the 2020 calendar,\u00a0<em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>\u00a0quickly closed up shop in March and\u00a0moved its spectral activity from July to 2021, but the film&#8217;s release date was later pushed further into the upcoming year,\u00a0settling on June. Sony&#8217;s Jason Reitman-directed entry in the\u00a0<em>Ghostbusters</em>\u00a0franchise stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, Paul Rudd and Finn Wolfhard.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Heights</strong><br />\nRelease date: June 18</p>\n<p><em>In the Heights</em>\u00a0was supposed to be the Tony-winning Lin-Manuel Miranda Broadway musical everyone was talking about this summer, but the film adaptation, directed by Jon M. Chu, was\u00a0delayed in the spring by almost a year, to June of 2021. The Warner Bros. title, like the rest of the studio&#8217;s 2021 slate, is set to stream on HBO Max the same day it hits the big screen. The film stars Anthony Ramos as a bodega owner who has mixed feelings about closing his store and going to his parents&#8217; homeland of the Dominican Republic after he inherits his grandmother&#8217;s fortune. The film also stars Corey Hawkins, Jimmy Smits, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Stephanie Beatriz and Dascha Polanco.</p>\n<p><strong>Top Gun: Maverick</strong><br />\nRelease date: July 2</p>\n<p>In early April, the long-awaited Tom Cruise sequel flew from its June 2020 release date\u00a0to Christmas\u00a0before breaking the 2021 barrier over the summer. In addition to Cruise, the Joseph Kosinski-directed film stars Jon Hamm, Jennifer Connelly, Glen Powell, Miles Teller and Jay Ellis.\u00a0Speaking to <em>THR</em>\u00a0earlier this year, Hamm, who&#8217;s seen a cut of the film, said of the delay, &#8220;Obviously, there was no way it was going to come out this summer because this summer has been canceled, but when they moved it to Christmas, I thought it felt like it needs to be a summer release. It just has that amazing Tom Cruise, tentpole blockbuster, summertime thing. It&#8217;s so good. It rides the line so perfectly between the nostalgia of the first one and the newness of this next chapter in the story. Obviously, Tom knocks it out of the park and all the young kids are great in it. It&#8217;s just a really good story. It&#8217;s the movie equivalent of a fist pump. You&#8217;re just like, &#8216;Yes!&#8217; It&#8217;s exactly what it&#8217;s meant to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Jungle Cruise</strong><br />\nRelease date: July 30</p>\n<p>Based on the Disneyland ride of the same name, the Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt starrer\u00a0in early April\u00a0sailed out of its summer 2020 release date and into another destination, a year later in 2021. The Jaume Collet-Serra-directed movie, set in the early 20th century, follows Johnson&#8217;s riverboat captain and Blunt&#8217;s scientist as they journey into the jungle to find the Tree of Life. Jack Whitehall, Edgar Ramirez, Jesse Plemons and Paul Giamatti round out the cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Candyman</strong><br />\nRelease date: Aug. 27</p>\n<p>The filmmakers behind\u00a0<em>Candyman</em>\u00a0kept saying his name in 2020, moving the release date of the spiritual sequel to the 1992 supernatural horror film from June\u00a0further\u00a0and\u00a0further\u00a0into the fall before\u00a0planning to haunt moviegoers in 2021. The MGM and Universal film, directed by Nia DaCosta and produced by Jordan Peele, who penned the script with DaCosta and Win Rosenfield, takes place in the now-gentrified area surrounding Chicago&#8217;s Cabrini-Green housing projects, where in the original film a grad student was investigating an urban legend about a hook-handed killer. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, Colman Domingo and Vanessa Williams star. While a number of films have opted for streaming or premium VOD releases this year, the team behind\u00a0<em>Candyman</em>\u00a0is committed to a theatrical release. Peele, <em>THR</em>\u00a0reported in September, played a prominent role in delaying the film&#8217;s release, worried about encouraging consumers to gather in an indoor theater amid the pandemic. Addressing the postponement on Twitter,\u00a0DaCosta wrote, &#8220;We made\u00a0<em>Candyman</em>\u00a0to be seen in theaters. Not just for the spectacle but because the film is about community and stories&#8211;how they shape each other, how they shape us. It\u2019s about the collective experience of trauma and joy, suffering and triumph and the stories we tell around it. We wanted the horror and humanity of\u00a0<em>Candyman</em>\u00a0to be experienced in a collective, a community, so we\u2019re pushing\u00a0<em>Candyman</em>\u00a0to next year, to ensure that everyone can see the film, in theaters, and share in that experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Death on the Nile</strong><br />\nRelease date: Sept. 17</p>\n<p>The Kenneth Branagh-directed follow-up to\u00a0<em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>\u00a0and, like its predecessor, is based on an Agatha Christie novel of the same name, finds Branagh&#8217;s Hercule Poirot searching for a murderer while on vacation in Egypt. The film from Disney&#8217;s 20th Century Studios hopped around the fall 2020 calendar before it was pushed into 2021 in December. In addition to Branagh, the film stars Tom Bateman, Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Ali Fazal, Dawn French and Gal Gadot.</p>\n<p><strong>Dune</strong><br />\nRelease date: Oct. 1</p>\n<p>Based on the groundbreaking 1965 Frank Herbert novel, Denis Villeneuve&#8217;s ambitious big-budget sci-fi film explores fate, politics, religion, ecology and war amid the backdrop of the planet Arrakis, known as Dune. Many have tried and failed to adapt the expansive, influential novel for the big screen, and it remains to be seen if Villeneuve, who directed and wrote the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, breaking the work into two films, has succeeded.\u00a0<em>Dune</em>\u00a0\u2014 which stars Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsgard \u2014 was originally set to hit theaters on Dec. 18, 2020 before\u00a0moving this fall\u00a0to October of 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Halloween Kills</strong><br />\nRelease date: Oct. 15</p>\n<p>Over the summer, David Gordon Green&#8217;s follow up to his Jamie Lee Curtis-starring 2018 revival of the horror series canceled its 2020 plans, opting instead\u00a0to scare moviegoers in October 2021. John Carpenter, who executive produces\u00a0<em>Halloween Kills</em>, explained the delay in\u00a0a letter from himself and Green posted on Twitter in July, writing that the team behind the film had &#8220;looked at the forecast of theatrical exhibition with obvious concern,&#8221; as they &#8220;discussed and struggled&#8221; with how best to present the film.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we release it in October of this year as planned, we have to face the reality that the film would be consumed in a compromised theatrical experience. After weighing our options, we have chosen to push the film&#8217;s theatrical release by one year,&#8221; Carpenter and Green wrote.

Police would give no further details on the incident or who made the report. </p>\n<p>Earlier Thursday at a video news conference, a woman said that on April 24, 2017, in Los Angeles, Hammer raped her for four hours, slammed her head against a wall and committed other violent acts against her. </p>\n<p>The Associated Press does not generally identify alleged victims of sexual assault. </p>\n<p>The woman appeared on camera but identified herself only by her first name, Effie. </p>\n<p>\u201cDuring those four hours I tried to get away but he wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI thought that he was going to kill me. He then left with no concern for my well-being.\u201d </p>\n<p>The woman\u2019s attorney, Gloria Allred, said they had given evidence to Los Angeles police, including photos of Effie\u2019s injuries. Allred declined to say when they made the report, and would not confirm that it was the one made in February that the LAPD is investigating. </p>\n<p>Effie was 20 when she and Hammer met on Facebook and began a relationship in 2016, and they had their last contact last year, Allred said. </p>\n<p>Hammer\u2019s attorney said in a statement that from the beginning he has maintained that all of his interactions with Effie and every other sexual partner \u201chave been completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory.\u201d </p>\n<p>The statement called her allegations \u201cattention seeking and ill-advised\u201d and said \u201cher own correspondence with Mr. Hammer undermines and refutes her outrageous allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the truth on his side, Mr. Hammer welcomes the opportunity to set the record straight,\u201d Andrew Brettler said. </p>\n<p>The statement included a screenshot that Brettler said was a text message exchange in July of last year between Hammer and Effie, in which she expresses a desire for rough, forceful sex with him, and he responds by saying he no longer wants a relationship with her. </p>\n<p>The 34-year-old actor was married at the time to television personality Elizabeth Chambers. They divorced last year. </p>\n<p>Hammer first gained fame through playing twins in 2010\u2019s \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d and is best known for his starring roles in 2017\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d and 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Lone Ranger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most recently, Hammer starred in the Netflix remake of \u201cRebecca.\u201d A sequel to \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d with Timothee Chalamet has also been in development. </p>\n<p>Allegations of sexual violence in recent months have derailed Hammer\u2019s career. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, an Instagram account began posting screenshots of text messages allegedly from Hammer as far back as 2016. Allred would not comment on whether her client was behind that account, @houseofeffie. When those text messages began appearing in media reports, Hammer called them \u201cvicious and spurious online attacks against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>After those texts were published, Hammer departed the comedy \u201cShotgun Wedding,\u201d in which he was to star alongside Jennifer Lopez, shortly before production was to begin. He soon after departed the Paramount+ series \u201cThe Offer,\u201d about the making of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hammer was also dropped by his agency, WME. </p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>Armie Hammer under investigation LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Actor Armie Hammer is under investigation for sexual assault, Los Angeles police [&hellip;]</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 0, "comment_status": "closed", "ping_status": "closed", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_mi_skip_tracking": false}, "categories": [1], "tags": [], "yoast_head": "<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2.1 -

Off the field, brands sought to relieve the tension of the game \u2014 and the year \u2014 with lighthearted commercials stuffed with celebrities and nostalgic characters.</p>\n<p>They aimed to connect to the estimated 100 million viewers who tune in to the Super Bowl broadcast each year.</p>\n<p>Cadillac updated the classic 1990 film \u201cEdward Scissorhands,\u201d M&#038;M\u2019s enlisted Dan Levy to show how a bag of M&#038;M\u2019s given as an apology can help people come together. And Will Ferrell teamed with GM \u2014 and Awkwafina and Kenan Thompson \u2014 on a madcap cross-country dash to promote electric vehicles. </p>\n<p>Perhaps the most striking effect: Virtually none of the ads featured people in masks, a public-health priority but also a grim reminder of the ongoing pandemic.</p>\n<p>With so many light spots, advertisers that took a different approach were more likely to be remembered. Jeep aired a two-minute ad in the second half of the game starring Bruce Springsteen urging people to find common ground. Oat milk maker Oatly opted for going weird.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe relentless stream of cheery ads made it tough for any of them to really stand out,\u201c said Northwestern University marketing professor Tim Calkins.</p>\n<p>Aiming to entertain</p>\n<p>In an effort to be light, advertisers stuffed \u2014 and sometimes overstuffed \u2014 their ads with celebrities.</p>\n<p>Cadillac enlisted \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d actor Timothee Chalamet to portray Edward Scissorhand\u2019s son enjoying the Cadillac Lyriq\u2019s hands-free \u201cSuper Cruise\u201d technology. Winona Ryder revisited her role in the classic 1990 move as his mother.</p>\n<p>Other ads combined celebrities with humor. Rocket Mortgage tapped comedian Tracy Morgan to show a family why being \u201cpretty sure\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it in situations like eating questionable mushrooms, skydiving \u2014 and taking out a mortgage. State Farm showed Paul Rudd and Drake as commercial set stand-ins. And Hellmann\u2019s enlisted comedian Amy Schumer as a \u201cFairy Godmayo\u201d that helped a man deal with his leftovers.</p>\n<p>TOUCHING ON POLITICS</p>\n<p>Most ads steered clear of politics, but there were some notable exceptions.</p>\n<p>Fiverr teased that its ad would feature Four Seasons Total Landscaping, the scene of an infamous Rudy Giuliani press conference during last year\u2019s tumultuous election, raising the question whether the ad would be political or not.</p>\n<p>It did not. Instead, the tongue-in-cheek ad was more about how small businesses can thrive with Fiverr. It featured Four Seasons Total Landscaping owner Marie Siravo talking about how to build a successful business with the help of Fiverr.</p>\n<p>But the strongest political statement of the night came from Jeep\u2019s two-minute ad featuring Bruce Springsteen. Even thought the Boss urged people to find common ground, the very idea of \u201cunity\u201d during this contentious election year has become polarizing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret the middle has been a hard place to get to lately, between red and blue, servant and citizen, freedom and fear,\u201d Springsteen intones, adding \u201cwe need the middle.\u201d</p>\n<p>FCA chief marketing officer Olivier Francois said it was worth taking the risk on a serious ad in order to create a \u201chealing\u201d commercial that will be remembered long after the game. \u201cThere\u2019s a divide and Bruce wants to do one thing, speak to the common ground,\u201d he said in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a stand, left or right, blue or red, the only stand it takes is the middle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt speaks to where we are now as a country and our need for \u201ccommon ground,\u201d said Vann Graves, executive director of the Brandcenter at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cClearly this is not a new approach, but in today\u2019s climate, it is an effective and necessary one.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Brooks Brasfield, 28, watching the game in Nashville with his wife, said the tone of the Jeep ad leaned too political for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like Springsteen and heartwarming ads like this generally, but this one feels too forced given the current political climate,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>GOING FOR WEIRD</p>\n<p>Oat milk company Oatly ran a surprise ad that showed its CEO singing with a keyboard in a field of Oats that its product is like milk but not milk. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a hit with David Simmons, 24, from Louisville, Ky., watching the game with his two roommates and his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just shockingly strange, I couldn\u2019t really focus on the next commercial,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was jarringly weird. I drink all types of milk, but I won\u2019t be drinking Oatly.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Kim Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia, said the ad \u201cis likely to stand out because it is so starkly different,\u201d She added, \u201cIt will drive awareness because of the size of the Super Bowl audience and is clear about what it is \u2014 and it is quirky. That might work for the target.\u201d</p>\n<p>MORE DIVERSITY</p>\n<p>Many ads this year featured a diverse cast, from Amazon\u2019s Alexa ad with two Black leads to job site Indeed\u2019s ad featuring a wide array of real-life job seekers. Mercari featured a mixed race couple in its ad and WeatherTech showed a diverse workforce of its real employees. </p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Hellmann\u2019s ad featuring Amy Schumer as the \u201cfairy GodMayo\u201d featured a Black lead and DoorDash\u2019s ad starred \u201cHamilton\u201d star Daveed Diggs singing and dancing through a Muppet-populated neighborhood. While it\u2019s hard to quantify how much more diverse the ads were this year, it\u2019s certainly a far cry from 2013, when there was an outcry after a Cheerio\u2019s ad featured a mixed race couple.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do and it\u2019s good business,\u201d said VCU\u2019s Graves. \u201cConsumers are now demanding that they see themselves reflected in brands they spend money on.\u201d</p>\n", "protected": false}, "excerpt": {"rendered": "<p>By MAE ANDERSON The Associated Press The mood on the field was tense during the Super Bowl as the Tampa [&hellip;]</p>\n", "protected": false}, "author": 1, "featured_media": 0, "comment_status": "closed", "ping_status": "closed", "sticky": false, "template": "", "format": "standard", "meta": {"_mi_skip_tracking": false}, "categories": [1], "tags": [], "yoast_head": "<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2.1 - https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ -->\n<title>Super Bowl ads went for light humor.
